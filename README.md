# chatMessenger
Welcome Everyone!!


I have created a simple Chat Messenger using networking libraries of Java. For the front end I have usied JFrame class of Applets.
Feel free use it, all you have to do is just run TestSever.java on the server computer and TestClient.java on the client!!

Maximum number of clients that can connect to the server at a time = 100


Happy Chatting <3
